## Project Description:

Draw Together is a collaborative drawing application developed with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Socket.IO, and JQuery. Provided that they are on the same network, multiple users can work on the same canvas that updates in real time based on user actions. Users can paint in multiple colors, change the thickness of their brush, and erase unwanted mistakes.
